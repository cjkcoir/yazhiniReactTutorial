In real-life MERN stack web application projects, certain React hooks are commonly used due to their utility in managing state, side effects, and other functionalities. Here are some of the most commonly used hooks:

1. **`useState`**: 
   - **Purpose**: To manage state in a functional component.
   - **Use Cases**: Managing form inputs, toggling UI elements, storing fetched data, etc.

2. **`useEffect`**:
   - **Purpose**: To perform side effects in functional components.
   - **Use Cases**: Fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, setting up subscriptions or timers, and cleaning up before unmounting components.

3. **`useContext`**:
   - **Purpose**: To access and manage global state across components.
   - **Use Cases**: Sharing user authentication status, theme settings, or any other global data across various components without prop drilling.

4. **`useMemo`**:
   - **Purpose**: To memoize expensive calculations so they only run when dependencies change.
   - **Use Cases**: Optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations, particularly in large or complex components.

5. **`useCallback`**:
   - **Purpose**: To memoize callback functions, preventing them from being recreated on every render.
   - **Use Cases**: Optimizing performance in components that rely on callbacks, especially when passing callbacks to child components that rely on `React.memo`.

6. **`useRef`**:
   - **Purpose**: To persist a mutable value across renders or directly access a DOM element.
   - **Use Cases**: Managing focus, scrolling, or integrating with third-party libraries that need direct DOM access.

7. **`useReducer`**:
   - **Purpose**: To manage complex state logic or when the state depends on previous state values.
   - **Use Cases**: Handling complex forms, managing state that involves multiple actions, or when state transitions are complex.

8. **`useLayoutEffect`**:
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
   - **Use Cases**: Measuring DOM elements, synchronizing animations, or any task that requires DOM manipulation before the browser paints.

9. **`useParams`** (from `react-router-dom`):
   - **Purpose**: To access URL parameters in components.
   - **Use Cases**: Retrieving dynamic segments of the URL, such as `userId` or `postId`, and using them to fetch specific data.

10. **`useNavigate`** (from `react-router-dom`):
    - **Purpose**: To programmatically navigate between routes.
    - **Use Cases**: Redirecting users after form submission, handling conditional navigation based on user actions or state.

These hooks form the backbone of many MERN stack applications, enabling developers to handle a wide range of functionalities efficiently and effectively.
